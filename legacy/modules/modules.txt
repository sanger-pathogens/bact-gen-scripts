My Modules:


Si_nexus

Methods:

	tree_to_string(treeObject, support_as_branchlengths=False,branchlengths_only=False,plain=True,plain_newick=False,ladderize=None)

		Prints a tree as a string. Fixes float problem in Bio.Nexus.Trees.Tree.to_string
		Code edited from BioPython

	midpoint_root(treeobject=None)
		
		Roots a Biopython:Nexus:Tree object on the midpoint
		Code edited from BioPython's root with outgroup
		
	parsimonious_SNP_reconstruction(treeObject, alignmentObject, locations=[], transformation="acctran")
		
		Function to parsimoneously reconstruct sites on a tree
	
	run_RAxML(alignmentObject, bootstrap=100, model="GTRGAMMA", cleanup=True)
	
		Runs a tree with RAxML using the options selected. Returns a tree object



Si_general

A few general functions that I use a lot

Methods:

	DoError(string="")
	
		Print an error message to the screen and exit
		
	


Si_SeqIO

A few functions to make biopython file handling easier

Methods:

	read_alignment(filename="")
	
		Will try to read an alignment file in all of the formats available in biopython starting with any clue in the file suffix
	
	write_embl_style_id(sequence, handle)
	
		Prints an embl ID line to filehandle using seqence to get the length
	
	write_embl_style_header(handle)
	
		Prints header rows to handle
	
	write_embl_style_sequence(sequence, handle)
	
		Prints sequence in embl sequence format to handle
	
	open_annotation(filename, sequence="")
	
		Will try to open filename in embl and genbank formats. If this fails it will try to fix the file to be in a embl format readable by biopython
		
		
		
Si_SNPs

SNP-related functions

Methods:

	snps_locations_from_alignment(alignmentObject)
		
		Returns locations of SNPs in alignmentObject as a list
