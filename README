FuzzyPath assembler for short reads

(1) Down load the pipeline

ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/zn1/fuzzypath/fuzzypath.tar

or

/nfs/disk69/ftp/pub/zn1/fuzzypath/fuzzypath.tar

(2) To install the program

tar xvf fuzzypath.tar
./install.csh

(3) To run the pipeline
(a) Single end reads:
./fuzzypath.csh -kmer 19 suis_20x1.fastq suis_20x1

(b) Pair end reads:
./fuzzypath.csh -kmer 19 -insert 180 suis_20x1.fastq suis_20x1

here "180" is the mean insert size. FuzzyPath extends short
reads to loner seuqences, which covere the genome at 15X by default. If you
like higher coverage, use "-reads xxxxx" to have more reads:

./fuzzypath.csh -kmer 19 -reads 20000 -insert 180 suis_20x1.fastq suis_20x1

(4) The assembly file:
suis_20x1.contigs.fa 

(5) Type ./fuzzypath.csh for help

================
Read file format
================
The FuzzyPath pipeline is based upon the Sanger fastq file format,
where quality values are correlated with Phred calculations. Quality 
values in Solexa and Sanger formats are different, but the file format
is very similar. The reads from Solexa machines are Solexa format. This 
might tell you if your data is in Solexa format:

"If the average quality value of the first 10 bases is more than, say
60 or 70, this file must be in the Solexa/Illumina format."

To convert Solexa fastq to Sanger fastq, please go to MAQ page and download 
the maq

http://maq.sourceforge.net/

maq sol2sanger in.sol.fastq out.sanger.fastq

If you are using ABI SOLiD files, make sure the read files are in line with 
Sanger format as quality values are frequently used in the code to
filter out base errors.

Report to Zemin Ning ( zn1@sanger.ac.uk ) for any problems.

Thank you for your interest in FuzzyPath.
